the React useMemo hook returns a memorized value.(it's like 
caching a value so that it doesn't need to be recalculated).

the usememo hook only runs when one of its dependencies gets updated.

this can improve the perfomance of application. there is one more hook
in react that can improve the perfomance, that is useCallback hook.


the useMemo and useCallback hooks are similar. The main difference is :
useMemo return a memorized  value.
useCallback returns a memorized function.
