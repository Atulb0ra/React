useReducer is similar to useState, But insted of providing
state and setter function it provides state and dispatch function.

the use reducer hook accepts two arguments
-Reducer Function
-initial state 
and returns : current state and dispatch method

the reducer function specifies how the function gets updated.

when we use useReducer we can efficiently update the state for different action
